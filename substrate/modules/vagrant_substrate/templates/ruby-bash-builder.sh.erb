# If we create the build directory from windows
# directly and populate it with the build files
# and attempt to build it will fail even though
# everything looks happy and cheerful. Then
# after hours of trying different environment
# setups, different directory paths, different
# shells only to continually get failures during
# configure with permission denied errors on the
# conftest.exe file we will end up scouring the
# mailing lists and SO for any hints as to what
# could possible be the underlying problem. This,
# of course, will be a fruitless endeavour and we
# will return to Windows broken, weary, angry,
# and confused. After more flailing interspersed
# with quiet sobs of frustration a peculiarity will
# be noticed. Creating a new directory from within
# the mingw64 shell, copying the files into the
# new directory, and building will not result in
# permission errors. In fact, the build works
# flawlessly. Thanks Windows.
